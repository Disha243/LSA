# Implementing Latent Space Auto regression for Novelty Detection for Brain MR images.
### Objective : To be able to classify the input Brain MR image as anomalous or non-anomalous.
Mainly focussing on the cifar10 and mnist module to understand how the autoencoder can be trained in order to reconstruct anomaly free Brain MR images.
Training on non-anomalous Brain MRI data
Validating on anomalous Brain MRI data
Testing on anomalous and non-anomalous Brain MRI data.
